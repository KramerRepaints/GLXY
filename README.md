GLXY is a full repaint of Super Mario Galaxy for the WII that contains around 1800 textures, nearly 70 audio edits, a few FMV edits, and alot of custom dialogue. GLXY also has a new story based on the VIZ Media series RWBY. 

Note: some of the UI textures are from Sy24's faithful HD textures mod, but some of them had been edited for this mod. If you do want the faithful HD textures mod yourself, get it here
